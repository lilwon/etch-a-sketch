# Etch-a-Sketch
View my project [here](https://lilwon.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)
A web version of the physical etch-a-sketch toy! 

## To Do
* Add more to dark theme and light theme
 

## Bugs
* Toggling from RGB Off to RGB On works only once. 
* If you toggle back to "RGB Off" the RGB mode is still on. This is because
the color settings uses a for loop. When an event listener activates it stays
on the previous action listener. Probably need to rewrite the functions and make
toggle using css. 

# Color Scheme
Looking into the [Nord Theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/#palettes-modularity) for colors.
